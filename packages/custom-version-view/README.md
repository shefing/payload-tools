## [Custom Version View plugin](./src/index.ts)

This plugin introduces additional fields to the version view for a more detailed and informative experience:

- **ðŸ•’ Updated At**: Displays the **relative date** of the last update, making it easy to track when changes were made (e.g., "3 hours ago").

- **ðŸ‘¤ Updated By**: Shows the **user** who made the last update.

### Install

Install the plugin using your node package manager, e.g:

`pnpm add @shefing/custom-version-view`

### Setup
In the payload.config.ts add the following:

```typescript
  plugins: [
    ...plugins,
    versionsPlugin({
      excludedCollections: [] //array of collections names to exclude
      excludeGlobals:[] //array of globals names to exclude
    })

The updated by field in versions relies on the authors-info package.
